# Overview

In this workshop, we will bridge the gap between advanced microscopy data generation and the computational skills required for its analysis. By leveraging open-source tools like [FIJI](https://fiji.sc) and [napari](https://napari.org), participants will learn to automate image analysis, enhancing the precision, efficiency, and reproducibility of their research. This two-day event, led by experienced core facility staff from the Francis Crick Institute and King's College London, offers a practical approach to mastering quantitative analysis and workflow automation, essential for advancing research across multiple domains.
